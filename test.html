        I come form middle class family. My mama is a DevOps Specialist. My mother is a logistics operator. I have a Younger brother and an  elder sister. My brother is studying grade sixth, and I am studying in grade eight. we are the apples of my mother’s eye.
The head of our family is our father jesus . His word is law for all. He is every thing for us. She gets up early and brings vegetables from the market in week days. She (My mother)  get ready for the office in time. She is very particular about punctuality. She expects this form all of use. She is kind and liberal. My mother has much to do. She does get the cooperation and help of my grandmother. She is a very early riser. After taking bath. Then grandmother follow other activities washing clothes, cleaning utensils and the house. She believes in doing every work with her own hands. She does not depend on the cook or the maid. She is a lady of lovable nature. She is somewhat conservative but not narrow minded. She is strong and courageous and commands respect with father my jesus. My father has a great regard for her. He never does anything without consulting him. She is just like a wise counsel for use. She is never peevish and unjust.
 There is cooperation and unity in our family. I have learnt the lesson of sympathy love and civic sense. In a way my family is the first school of civic sense for my family is the first school of civic sense for my brother and sister. Once in a day, all the members sit together and talk about certain things concerning the house and life in general.
Many a problem is solved with mutual help. In this we have the least botheration and inconvenience in life. We lead a very smooth and peaceful life. If never anyone of the members falls ill he is nursed and served so carefully that he recovers soon. It is my great fortune to have been born in such a family. I wish and pray India to love such ideal and true families as may make democracy a real success. Congrats India. Thankyou and Amen.
